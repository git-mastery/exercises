# remote-branch-rename

## Task

You have a branch, `improve-loadding`, and you need to rename it.

This branch has already been pushed up to a remote repository, so you need a way around that!

1. Rename the `improve-loadding` branch to `improve-loading`
2. Ensure that the change is reflected on the remote repository as well
