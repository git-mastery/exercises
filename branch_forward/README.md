# branch-forward

You are outlining a story and experimenting with different plotlines. Each version lives on its own branch, and you now need to fold the right storyline back into `main` without cluttering the history.

## Learning objectives

- Identify when a branch can be fast-forward merged
- Use fast-forward merges to keep the commit graph linear
- [Fast-forward merges](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/book/gitAndGithub/merge/index.html)

## Task

1. Review the `with-sally` and `with-ginny` branches.
2. Merge only the branch(es) that can be fast-forwarded into `main`.
3. Leave other branches (if any) unmerged.
