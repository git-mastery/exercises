# branch-compare

## Task

You are recording a numerical data stream from two sources. The data are stored in `data.txt`, using a different branch for each stream. The two data streams are supposed to be identical but can vary on rare occasions.

Answer the questions given in `answers.txt`.

Run `gitmastery verify` to check if your answers are correct.
