# branch-delete

## Task

You have two branches: `optimization-approach-1` and `optimization-approach-2` and you need to delete them!

You decided to go ahead with `optimization-approach-1` so you merged it and you can delete the branch already.

Since you don't need `optimization-approach-2`, you should delete it WITHOUT merging.

1. Delete the `optimization-approach-1` branch
2. Delete the `optimization-approach-2` branch safely
