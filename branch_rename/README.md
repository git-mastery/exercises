# branch-rename

## Task

You have two branches: `try-quick-fix` and `improve-loadding` and you need to rename them.

`try-quick-fix` is only available on your local machine, `improve-loadding` has already been pushed up to a remote repository, so you need a way around that!

1. Rename the `try-quick-fix` branch to `fix-scrolling-bug`
2. Rename the `improve-loadding` branch to `improve-loading`
3. Ensure that the change is reflected on the remote repository as well
