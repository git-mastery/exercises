# tags-update

The `duty-roster` repo contains text files that track which people are assigned for duties on which days of the week. Some of tags added earlier needs found to be incorrect.

## Task

1. To make tag names consistent, change `first-update` tag to `january-update`.
2. The `april-update` tag is currently pointing to the commit that updates the duty roster for May. Move it to the correct commit.
