# fetch-and-pull

## Task

You have been given a clone of the `git-mastery/gm-shapes` repo.

Another developer Alice's has created a remote copy of this repo at <https://github.com/git-mastery/gm-shapes-alice> which seems to have an additional commit in the `main` branch.

Add that repo as a remote titled `alice-upstream`, and bring over Alice's additional commit to your repo.

Alice's friend Bob has copied Alice's repo to <https://github.com/git-mastery/gm-shapes-bob>, and added one more commit.

Add that repo as another remote titled `bob-remote`, and fetch (not pull or merge) his new commit to your repo.
